Provide a detailed prompt for continuing our conversation.
The summary you construct will be used so that another agent can read it and continue the work.

Focus on information that would be helpful for continuing the conversation,
including what we did, what we're doing, which files we're working on,
and what we're going to do next.

When constructing the summary, use this template:

---

## Goal
[What goal(s) is the user trying to accomplish?]

## Instructions
- [Important instructions the user gave that are relevant]
- [If there is a plan or spec, include information about it]
- [User preferences and constraints that should persist]

## Discoveries
[Notable things learned during the conversation — errors encountered, environment details, code architecture, dependencies, etc.]

## Accomplished
[What work has been completed, what is still in progress, and what is left to do?]

## Relevant files
[Structured list of relevant files that have been read, edited, or created, with brief notes on each]
